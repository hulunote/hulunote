**🚀 Hulunote v0.1 released**

An open-source outliner note app that doubles as an **MCP client AI workspace**.

Not just notes. Not just AI chat.
Your **knowledge graph can call tools**.

**Highlights**

* 🧩 Built-in **MCP client** — connect to your own MCP servers like Claude Desktop / VS Code tools
* 🧠 Outliner + **bidirectional links** for networked thought
* 🤖 Notes become an **AI tool interface**, not static text
* ⚡ Frontend in **ClojureScript**
* 🦀 Backend in Rust

If you’re into **ClojureScript + AI tools + knowledge graphs**, this is for you.
